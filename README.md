Hello, this is the guide on how to start the code for my project on your local machine.
Firstly, you can clone my repo and use a text editor such as visual studio code to view the code.
It is important that you then open up a terminal to the project directory and type in "npm install"
Next, type in "cd frontend" and type the same command "npm install". If you wish to run the code on your machine, simply change the directory to the backend by typing in "cd backend" and use the command "python app.py".
Open a new terminal and direct yourself to the frontend directory by typing in "cd frontend", then you can type in "npm start" to open a local instance of the project on localhost. Ensure the ports are not blocked before doing so.
